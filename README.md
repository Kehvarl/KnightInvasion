# KnightInvasion

Protect your cave from the invading knights!

Knights march towards the cave.  If they reach the cave they take treasure and carry it away.

If you shoot a knight they become a statue, and knights will change direction when they encounter one

Princesses leave tokens on statues that cause knights to rush towards the cave

Sheep come straight to you, but knights don't want to cross the sheep trails
